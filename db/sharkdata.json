Caffeindicator is a litmus-like indicator to test whether coffee is regular or decaf. But this isn't a stand-alone product, at least not the way it was pitched. The idea is to get these indicators printed on the sugar or artificial sweetener packets that you see at the coffee shop, restaurant, or diner. It would have been a good idea for distribution, since it takes advantage of how these packets are already ubiquitous. Unfortunately for the caffeine-averse though, this product still hasn't hit the market, even years after its Shark Tank debut.

It goes everywhere you go and you use it repeatedly throughout the day. But unlike most other things that get daily wear and tear, you probably don't wash your phone, so it's been accumulating germs since the day you acquired it. Now thanks to PhoneSoap, there's an easy and highly effective way to zap the microbes off your phone. PhoneSoap is a charger for your smartphone that encloses it in a UV case, which emits light in the UV-C range that kills 99.99% of bacteria. It disinfects your phone it just 5 minutes, but it's also safe to leave it in there all night while it charges too. You'll still be able to hear any notifications through the built-in audio amplifier. One of the advantages of the PhoneSoap charger over other products, such as anti-bacterial wipes for wireless devices, is that it's a one-time investment. You'll be able to use the charger again and again without having to reorder or spend more money. You also won't even need to remember to wipe your phone, since you'll be charging it either way. Although this germicidal phone charger is the company's flagship product, as well as its first, they've also added cleaning pads and a touchscreen polish stick to the lineup.","episode":"16","category":"Storage and Cleaning Products","entrepreneurs":"Dan Barnes and Wesley LaPorte","location":"Provo, UT","website":"https://www.phonesoap.com","askedFor":"300000","exchangeForStake":"8","valuation":"4000000","season":"6","shark1":"Lori Greiner","shark2":"Barbara Corcoran","shark3":"Robert Herjavec","shark4":"Kevin O'Leary","shark5":"Mark Cuban","title":"Phone Soap","episode-season":"6-16","Multiple Entreprenuers":"True","coords":{"long":-111.6585337,"lat":40.2338438},"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528740561666-dc2479dc08ab?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMjk2MjB8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxTdG9yYWdlJTIwYW5kJTIwQ2xlYW5pbmclMjBQcm9kdWN0c3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2NDUzMTg0ODY&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080"},{"deal":"True","description":"Drain Strain is a revolutionary, never-clog drain stopper.","episode":"17","category":"Storage and Cleaning Products","entrepreneurs":"Naushad Ali","location":"Springfield, MO","website":"http://www.drainstrain.com","askedFor":"110000","exchangeForStake":"15","valuation":"733333","season":"6","shark1":"Lori Greiner","shark2":"Barbara Corcoran","shark3":"Robert Herjavec","shark4":"Kevin O'Leary","shark5":"Mark Cuban","title":"Drain Strain","episode-season":"6-17","Multiple Entreprenuers":"False","coords":{"long":-93.29229889999999,"lat":37.2089572},"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528740561666-dc2479dc08ab?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMjk2MjB8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxTdG9yYWdlJTIwYW5kJTIwQ2xlYW5pbmclMjBQcm9kdWN0c3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2NDUzMTg0ODY&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080"},{"deal":"False","description":"BedJet is the world's first ultra-rapid cooling, heating and climate control system made just for your bed.","episode":"17","category":"Home Accessories","entrepreneurs":"Mark Aramli","location":"Newport, RI","website":"http://bedjet.com","askedFor":"250000","exchangeForStake":"10","valuation":"2500000","season":"6","shark1":"Lori Greiner","shark2":"Barbara Corcoran","shark3":"Robert Herjavec","shark4":"Kevin O'Leary","shark5":"Mark Cuban","title":"BedJet","episode-season":"6-17","Multiple Entreprenuers":"False","coords":{"long":-71.3128285,"lat":41.4901024},"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514237487632-b60bc844a47d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMjk2MjB8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxIb21lJTIwQWNjZXNzb3JpZXN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjQ1MzE4OTQ2&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080"},{"deal":"False","description":"Balm Chicky Balm Balm is a sassy '70s-themed lip gloss brand that's made for value and practicality.
